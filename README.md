## WHAT IS RUBRIC
Rubric is an efficient personal recipe management web application.  It provides a full recipe management service, free of charge, that allows users to have access to a selection of recipes, including their own all in one place.
## WHAT DOES IT DO
It allows users to Create, Read, Update and Delete Recipe Documents. It also has features that allow registered users to save recipes they like and rate other peoples recipes.

## HOW IT WORKS FOR USERS
There are 2 stages of access

1. **Unregistered Access:** This allows users to view all recipes without being able to add, save or edit. It also limits their access to a products, tools and discounts page.
1. **Registered Access:** Once the user has logged in or registered, they can Create, Read, Update, Delete, Save and Rate recipes on the application. 
(*The user can only edit and delete their own recipes and can only rate the recipes of others*)

### **Creation and Design**

### **Behaviour Driven Development vs Test Driven Development or Acceptance Test Driven Development**

Due to the complexity of the application test driven development was paramount when developing the system. The behaviour needed to match the users needs but the functionality needed to pass essential tests to be a viable web application.

### **UX - STRATEGY:**

The application is designed to provide an essential service to users looking for an online recipe management system.

### **UX - STRUCTURE:**

The next plane to approach was Structure. What the application will do and and the external factors that might affect it.
This allowed an insight into the user experience and how a visitor uses the application.

**Here is the link to the structural sitemap:**

### **UX - SKELETON:**

The skeleton of this project was designed and established using Balsamiq (Cloud): https://balsamiq.cloud/

### **Wireframe Designs**

All wireframe designs can be found here:

### **UX - SURFACE:**

The final element to consider was the surface plane of UX design. This is the look and feel of the application.
Below are some screen shots of the application in use:

## **Style / Theme**

- It was important to me that the application remained gender neutral in order to maximise potential user scope. Upon researching current applications it appears many have a feminine tone which might discourage male users. From the start i intended the site to be bright, fun and intuitive.
The main COLOR scheme used includes:
- **Coral** (#ff7e50)
- **Teal** (#00897b)
- **White** (#ffffff)
As the application is centered around recipes and cooking i used a Chef Hat Symbol as the maing logo.
The FONTS used were from Google Fonts:
- **Fredoka One**
- **Gayathri**
To maintain the idea of being approachable, bright and friendly i used supporting colors for icons and buttons:
- **Pink** (#e91f63)
- **Purple** (#9c27b0)
- **Yellow** (#fdd835)


This was maintained throught the application using a mix of customised CSS and Materialize framework.
